#Code Introduction

##File Types

The 'category' and 'process' files are mainly used to generate dictionaries for the corresponding relationships between movie IDs, users, and categories.

The 'eval' file compares the top-1 to top-20 accuracy of two algorithms, item2vec and Graph-item2vec.

The 'result' file generates t-SNE plots for the two algorithms.

**The required libraries can be downloaded using the import statements in the code.**
